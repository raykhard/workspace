        <p class="white-text">This is basically about music.<br> The keys, the scales, the octaves and everythig else. <br>
            My music experience started with an instrument called a recorder. It is an instrument that is 
            rarely used but actually gives a fine tune. It's sound is so devine and a good thing is its actually
            easy to learn.</p>
        <p class="white-text">view more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recorder_(musical_instrument)">information on recorders</a></p>
        <p class="white-text">I played the recorder for about 2 years and then i joined a band. For about the next two years I plsyed the saxophone. To be exact i was playing the alto saxophone. there are actually four types of saxophones</p>
        <p class="white-text">The four types of saxophones:</p>
        <ol class="white-text">
            <li>Soprano saxophone.</li>
            <li>Alto saxophone</li>
            <li>Tenor saxophone</li>
            <li>Bass saxophone</li>
        </ol>
        <input type="text" placeholder="instrument desired">
        <p class="white-text">with the alto saxophone playing music became more and more difficult. 
            It posesses more than 30 buttons and each button when pressed produces
            a different soud while one is playing. The saxophoneand the recorder are both 
            wind instruments.</p>
